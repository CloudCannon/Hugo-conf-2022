        title: Helping Humans at Scale with Continuous Delivery of Hugo on AWS
        description: >-
          Learn to create Hugo websites that continuously deploy to AWS S3
          Static Hosting and Amazon CloudFront CDN. One of the advantages of
          building on top of the AWS cloud is that it is a globally distributed
          highly available system. In this talk, I walk through how to create
          and then continuously deploy training content-based websites through
          AWS technologies and Github.

        title: My journey from LAMP stack to Jamstack with Hugo!
        description: >-
          After doing websites with LAMP stack for 2 decades I decided to give a
          try to JAMStack with Hugo, and I fell in love with Hugo at first
          sight. This talk will show the first steps and results of working with
          Hugo from the perspective of a LAMP stack developer. People will know
          the difference between the platforms, why I chose Hugo, how Hugo
          improved the development process, the quality of the website and how
          it reduced my deployment time without investing too much time on
          learning it.

        title: 'Limitless HTTP requests with Hugo: from basic GET to GraphQL'
        description: >-
          In this talk, weâ€™ll explore resources.GetRemote, the new HTTP request
          solution for Hugo! Weâ€™ll cover basic GET requests and see how to
          process their response data or handle their errors. Then weâ€™ll
          experiment with more complex POST and UPDATE requests in the context
          of managing a search index with MeiliSearch REST API. Finally, weâ€™ll
          use the Shopify Storefront API as a case study for performing GraphQL
          requests with Hugo!

        title: Going wild with Hugo modules
        description: "The Nuance TechPubs team produces documentation for multiple products. Because these products are stand-alone, they require their own Hugo projects. But we needed to reuse content between projects and ensure that products in the same line share the same look and feel.\n\nTo implement this, we went wild with Hugo modules! \n\nThis presentation will show how we:\n\nâ€¢ Created a module that contains the building blocks that apply to all projects;\nâ€¢\_Stored project-specific assets, layouts, and content in this module;\nâ€¢\_Created modules for components that are shared between products;\nâ€¢\_Used the Hugo configuration files to pull in the correct content."
