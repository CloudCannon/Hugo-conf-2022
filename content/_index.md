        title: 'Automated migration at scale: Migrate to Hugo from any existing site'
        description: >-
          One of the biggest hurdles to using a static site generator like Hugo
          is the initial transition from a different build tool, or a monolithic
          legacy CMS (WordPress, Drupal, etc). Of course, the advantages of an
          SSG are huge: you can select the best hosting, CI/CD, and CMS options
          for yourself, and maintain full control of your site content, without
          the same maintenance overheads.

          <br/><br/>Using our (very) new open-source tool <u><a
          href="https://staticshape.app">StaticShape</a></u>, I‚Äôll show the
          beginnings of a new process ‚Äî migrating and converting any site's
          static output to a set of templates, markup, and layouts ready for use
          in Hugo.

        description: >-
          We will explore a strategy of separating the contents of your website
          from the source code like theme, partials, etc. It is a strategy that
          Elio has taken to allow contributors to edit the content without
          fiddling with the source code and accidentally breaking it.<br/>
          <br/>You will learn how you can separate the content, and how you can
          keep it all in sync.

        title: Improving Access to 4M U.S. Laws with Hugo
        description: >-
          U.S. laws are scattered across more than 130 government websites with
          varying quality (scanned dot matrix printouts!), searchability, and
          accessibility. The data is also published by legal research companies,
          but much of the data is only available behind paywalls for law firms.
          Meanwhile, people, including attorneys, are asking legal questions to
          LLMs trained on pre-pandemic law. <br/><br/>At this talk, OpenLaws
          discusses how we use Hugo to publish 4 million pieces of legal data in
          our efforts to make our laws more accessible to everyone. We‚Äôll share
          our approach to generating and hosting millions of pages and our CI/CD
          pipeline.

          We will share our real-world experiences in improving the search
          functionality of <a href="https://papercut.com">papercut.com</a>, a

          we'll explore the challenges and lessons learned in creating a more
          effective website search. We'll discuss why the usual open-source
          solutions might not always be the best fit and provide straightforward
          guidance on the essential factors to consider when upgrading your
          site's search features. Plus, we'll offer a simple technical demo to
          illustrate our practical approach. <br/><br/>Come along and discover

        title: How to Turn a Hugo Website into a PWA for better user engagement
        description: >-
          I'll start with an overview of PWAs, highlighting their benefits like
          enhanced performance, offline access, and immersive experiences. Then
          I'll introduce Hugo, a dynamic static site generator, and I'll explore
          how its speed and simplicity make it an excellent candidate for PWA
          conversion. I'll then break down PWA essentials, explaining service
          workers that enable background processes, caching, and offline
          functionality. I'll choose a Hugo theme and will publish it to
          Netlify. Then I'll start converting a Hugo site into a PWA, guiding
          attendees through service worker implementation for intelligent
          caching and offline capabilities. Crafting a Web App Manifest comes
          next, ensuring metadata and icons create a captivating user
          experience.

        title: Use of The Good Docs Project content Templates as Archetypes in Hugo
        description: >-
          Hugo archetypes provide an easy way to generate new content from
          existing files. The Good Docs Project provides a suite of markdown
          templates that can be freely used for typical content types in any
          project. This talk demonstrates how easy it is to take the provided
          templates and make new content files from them as Hugo archetypes.

        title: Introducing HUGE, a Hugo framework
        description: >-
          Even though Hugo handles a lot from configuration, most of its later
          features (pipes, js.build, image transformation) do not. HUGE aligns
          their ease of use with other features of Hugo. Namely: configuration
          files!<br/><br/> This means users don't have to educate themselves
          about the Pipes or Media transformation APIs and can focus on what
          matters: HTML, Javascript, CSS. <br/><br/>We‚Äôll review how easy it is
          to setup HUGE, how to configure your project‚Äôs asset pipeline with it,
          and how it can help you handle other things like local environment
          variables, or self hosted fonts!
