      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1><p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and
      volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code
      of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We
      expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment
      for everybody.</p><h3>Shorter version</h3><p>HugoConf is dedicated to
      providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
      gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
      participants in any form.</p><p>This code of conduct applies to all
      HugoConf spaces, including the online conference itself, our mailing list
      and our social media properties both online and off. Anyone who violates
      this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at
      the discretion of the Organisers.</p><p>Some HugoConf spaces may have
      additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to
      participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by
      these rules.</p><h3>Longer version</h3><p>HugoConf is dedicated to
      providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate
      harassment of participants in any form.</p><p>This code of conduct applies
      to all HugoConf spaces, including the online conference itself, our
      mailing list and our social media properties both online and off. Anyone
      who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these
      spaces at the discretion of the Organisers.</p><p>Some HugoConf spaces may
      have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to
      participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by
      these rules.</p><p>Harassment includes:</p><ul><li>Offensive comments

      person&rsquo;s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to
      food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li><li>Deliberate
      misgendering or use of &lsquo;dead&rsquo; or rejected
      names</li><li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces
      where they&rsquo;re not appropriate</li><li>Physical contact and simulated
      physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like &ldquo;*hug*&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;*backrub*&rdquo;) without consent or after a request to
      stop.</li><li>Threats of violence</li><li>Incitement of violence towards
      any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to

      after requests to cease</li><li>Deliberate &ldquo;outing&rdquo; of any
      aspect of a person&rsquo;s identity without their consent except as
      necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional
      abuse</li><li>Publication of non-harassing private
      communication</li></ul><p>HugoConf prioritizes marginalized people&rsquo;s
      safety over privileged people&rsquo;s comfort. Organisers will not act on
      complaints regarding:</p><ul><li>&lsquo;Reverse&rsquo; -isms, including
      &lsquo;reverse racism,&rsquo; &lsquo;reverse sexism,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;cisphobia&rsquo;</li><li>Reasonable communication of boundaries,
      such as &ldquo;leave me alone,&rdquo; &ldquo;go away,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not discussing this with
      you.&rdquo;</li><li>Communicating in a &lsquo;tone&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t
      find congenial</li><li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise
      oppressive behavior or assumptions</li></ul><h3>Reporting</h3><p>If you
      are being harassed by a member of HugoConf, notice that someone else is
      being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Organisers
      at support@cloudcannon.com. If the person who is harassing you is on the
      team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will
      respond as promptly as we can.</p><p>This code of conduct applies to
      HugoConf spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of HugoConf
      outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all
      good-faith reports of harassment by HugoConf members seriously. This
      includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at
      any point in time. The Organisers reserve the right to exclude people from
      HugoConf based on their past behavior, including behavior outside HugoConf
      spaces and behavior towards people who are not in HugoConf.</p><p>In order
      to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to
      reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports
      intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without
      response.</p><p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose
      of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a
      person about whom we&rsquo;ve received harassment complaints, or privately
      warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
      the safety of HugoConf members or the general public. We will not name
      harassment victims without their affirmative
      consent.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><p>Participants asked to stop any
      harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p><p>If a
      participant engages in harassing behavior, Organisers may take any action
      they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all HugoConf
      spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other
      HugoConf members or the general public.</p>
